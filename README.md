# Python Battleship Game

Welcome to the Python Battleship Game! This is a simple, text-based version of the classic game Battleship.

## Description

The game is played on a 5x5 grid where a single battleship is randomly placed. The player has 4 turns to guess the location of the battleship. Each guess consists of specifying a row and a column on the grid. If you guess correctly, you sink the battleship; if not, you're given a hint and allowed to guess again until you either sink the battleship or run out of turns.

## Features

- Text-based Battleship game
- Randomized placement of the battleship
- Player input for guessing the battleship's location
- Feedback on each guess, including hits, misses, and repeated guesses
- Limit of 4 turns to find the battleship

## How to Play

1. **Guess the Location**: When prompted, enter the row and column numbers where you think the battleship is located. The grid is 5x5, so valid numbers are from 0 to 4.
2. **Feedback**: After each guess, the game will inform you if you've hit or missed the battleship. If you guess a location you've already tried, the game will let you know.
3. **Winning and Losing**: Sink the battleship within 4 turns to win. If you fail to do so after 4 turns, the game is over.
